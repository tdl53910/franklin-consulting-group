      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Franklin Consulting Group was established through the Student Government
        Association to expand access to structured, client-based experiential learning
        within the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this structure of hands-on learning we intend to permit undergraduate students
        across all Franklin disciplines to participate in career-oriented projects aligned 
        with their academic skillsets, reinforcing the growing emphasis on applied learning 
        and professional preparation in undergraduate education. Through a wide range of skills, 
        such as computing, politics, entrepreneurship, biological sciences, and laboratory research,
        we hope to equip students with the foundational proficiencies and practical experiences for 
        post-graduate careers.
